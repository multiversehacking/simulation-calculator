What Is This?

This project contains an interactive Simulation Probability Calculator, inspired by the Drake Equation but applied to simulation theory.

Instead of estimating the number of extraterrestrial civilizations, this calculator estimates the probability that a randomly selected world (a universe) is:

base reality

a simulated universe generated by simulation-running civilizations

The model is simple and transparent, allowing you to adjust assumptions and instantly see how they affect the probability that our universe is “base.”

How It Works

The calculator uses these inputs:

C: number of simulation-capable civilizations per base universe

f_run: percentage of those civilizations that actually run simulations

k: number of simulated universes created per sim-running civilization

d: fixed maximum nesting depth (for fixed-depth mode)

p_allow: probability a simulated universe spawns another layer (probabilistic mode)

m = k × p_allow: mean branching factor

The calculator outputs:

S: expected simulated universes per running civilization

CFS: expected sim-to-base world ratio

P(base): probability our universe is base

P(sim): probability our universe is simulated

Odds: expressed as “1 in N” chance of being base

Nesting Modes
1. Fixed Depth (d)

Simulation layers stop after a fixed number of generations.
The total simulated universes follow a geometric series:

S = k + k² + … + kᵈ

2. Probabilistic (capped)

Each simulation spawns the next layer with probability p_allow, up to a maximum cap D.

3. Probabilistic (infinite)

If m = k × p_allow is less than 1, the expected number of simulated universes converges:

S = k / (1 − m)

If m is 1 or greater, simulated universes diverge and the probability of being base approaches zero.
