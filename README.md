## What Is This?

This project contains an interactive **Simulation Probability Calculator**, inspired by the Drake Equation but applied to simulation theory.

Instead of estimating the number of extraterrestrial civilizations, this calculator estimates the probability that a randomly selected world (a universe) is:

- **base reality**, or  
- **a simulated universe** generated by simulation-running civilizations.

The model is simple and transparent, allowing you to adjust assumptions and instantly see how they affect the probability that our universe is “base.”

## How It Works

The calculator uses these inputs:

- **C**: number of simulation-capable civilizations per base universe  
- **f_run**: percentage of those civilizations that actually run simulations  
- **k**: number of simulated universes created per sim-running civilization  
- **d**: fixed maximum nesting depth (for fixed-depth mode)  
- **p_allow**: probability a simulated universe spawns another layer (probabilistic mode)  
- **m = k × p_allow**: mean branching factor  

The calculator outputs:

- **S**: expected simulated universes per running civilization  
- **CFS**: expected sim-to-base world ratio  
- **P(base)**: probability our universe is base  
- **P(sim)**: probability our universe is simulated  
- **Odds**: expressed as “1 in N” chance of being base

## Nesting Modes

### **1. Fixed Depth (d)**

Simulation layers stop after a fixed number of generations.

If each civilization creates **k** simulated universes, the total simulated universes form:

S = k + k² + … + kᵈ

Which evaluates to:

- **S = k(1 − kᵈ) / (1 − k)** for k ≠ 1  
- **S = d** for k = 1

### **2. Probabilistic (Capped)**

Each simulation spawns the next layer with probability **p_allow**, but nesting is capped at depth **D**.

m = k × p_allow  
S = k × (1 − mᴰ) / (1 − m)

If m = 1:

S = k × D

---

### **3. Probabilistic (Infinite)**

If m < 1:

S = k / (1 − m)

If m ≥ 1, expected simulated universes diverge → **P(base) → 0**

---

## Probability Formula

CFS = C × (f_run/100) × S

P(base) = 1 / (1 + CFS)  
P(sim)  = 1 − P(base)

Odds = “1 in (1/P(base))”
